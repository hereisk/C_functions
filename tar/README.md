# my_tar

Run Makefile to compile the program. The current implementation handles only files and does not work with directories and subdirectories.

my_tar allows the following option:
• -c  - create a new archive
• -x  - extract archive members
• -r  - append a new archive member to the end of the archive
• -u  - append a new archive member to the end of the archive if the last modification is newer than the archive member within the archive
